# So when?

---

## Don't

- your project is done (but document it)
- You think "Contract first" reeks of waterfall
- You drank the `gRPC` or `graphQL` coolaid
- You don't care about documentation

---

## Do

- new project
- flexibility is key
- many stake holders
- good documentation is needed
- many consumers
