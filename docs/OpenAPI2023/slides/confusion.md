# Name confusion?

- OpenAPI (3.x) is the name of the Specification
- Until 2.x it was called "Swagger"
- Swagger UI is one way to show an API ([ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) is another)
- Swagger is colloquially used for OpenAPI
  like "Scotch Tape" for "sticky Tape" (unless you are German)
